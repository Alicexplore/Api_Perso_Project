# The_Photo_Project

The Photo Project is a small game App to find your next travel destination by selecting your favourites photographs,
the ones you love will lead you to your next journey ‚úà

<br />

## About this project
Worked on a little idea called ‚ÄúThe Photo Project‚Äù, which aims to help you discover your next journey by selecting stunning photographs. üì∏
<br /><br />
It's a really interesting exercise to see that starting with a simple project idea, things quickly become very complicated for a beginner like me.
<br /><br />
But I'm making progress on this project step by step, feature by feature, and mainly learning that one resolved feature leads to a new one.
<br />
I think that's the whole story and challenge of being a developer.
<br /><br />
Fun üññüèº
